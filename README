Sam's Personal DWM Build:

List of patches:
    always center
    fake fullscreen
    ru_gaps
    ru_bottomattach
    scratchpads
    systray (removed)
    warp
    
 
Archiving this because I made my own fork of Luke Smith's build of dwm. It has some things I like and fixed some issues with the gaps I don't wanna deal with.
I may fork this one day and renew it to my vision, only when I get more knowledge though.
